**A – Action:**  
I looked at my academic projects, such as building applications using Java and Kotlin, and managing data through SQL. I also explored machine learning out of personal interest, taking time to understand how data is used to create intelligent systems. I identified transferable skills like problem-solving, attention to detail, communication, and teamwork, which I’ve developed through both individual and group tasks.

**R – Result:**  
This reflection helped me realize that I am most passionate about solving problems using code, understanding how systems work, and working with data.

### 📝 Reflection (STAR)
### ⭐ S – Situation  
As a final-year ICT student planning my next steps, I took part in a **Personality Assessment** module based on the Holland Code (RIASEC) model. I’ve always known I enjoy tech, but this was my first time intentionally connecting my personality to real career options in the field. I wanted to understand not just what I’m good at, but *why certain tasks energize me more than others*.

### 🎯 T – Task  
The task involved exploring six personality types — Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional — and identifying which ones best describe me. The goal was to reflect on how these traits influence my career preferences, learning style, and how I function in a team or work setting.

### ⚙️ A – Action  
I took time to complete the assessment honestly, answering questions about what I enjoy, how I solve problems, and the kinds of work environments I prefer. My results highlighted both **Investigative** and **Conventional** traits.  
To go deeper, I:

- Revisited my academic and personal projects (e.g., building a weather app and writing SQL queries) to see how these traits showed up in practice.  
- Compared personality descriptions with my experiences — realizing that my love for structured data, step-by-step problem-solving, and deep analysis clearly align with these two types.  
- Reflected on how I thrive in organized, logic-driven environments where I can work independently but also support broader team objectives.

### ✅ R – Result  
The assessment gave me clarity: I’m naturally drawn to roles that require precision, problem-solving, and structure — like **data analysis**, **backend development**, or even **machine learning engineering**.  
It also helped me accept that it’s okay to prefer solo work when I’m focused, and that I bring real value through consistency, analytical thinking, and systems-oriented work. This reflection is now shaping how I tailor my CV, choose electives, and even who I look to for mentorship. It reminded me that success comes not just from skills, but from aligning with your core personality.
