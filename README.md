### 📝 Reflection
 
As a final-year ICT student, I felt uncertain about which area of tech would suit me best—there were so many options, from software development to UX design.
 
My goal was to gain clarity on potential career paths and understand which roles aligned with my strengths and long-term interests.

I booked a series of one-on-one career counselling sessions, completed aptitude and interest inventories, and discussed my project experiences (like my weather app and Java/Kotlin work) with a professional counsellor. Together, we mapped my skills (problem solving, creativity, technical know-how) to various ICT roles and explored real-world job descriptions.


By the end of the counselling process, I had a clear shortlist of roles—namely front-end development and UI/UX design—that excite me. I also left with an action plan: build a small UI/UX portfolio, take an online design fundamentals course, and network with professionals in those fields. This clarity has energized my final months of study and given me concrete next steps for my career journey.

### 💡Reflection
  
As a final-year Application Development student at Cape Peninsula University of Technology, I’ve gained a range of both technical and soft skills.Through this process, I identified strong hard skills in programming (Java, JavaScript, Python, Kotlin), Android app development, working with databases and SQL, and using tools like Anaconda and IntelliJ. I also recognized important soft skills I’ve developed, such as teamwork, time management, clear communication, problem-solving, attention to detail, and adaptability—especially when working on group projects or troubleshooting code.

 Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in machine learning and working with databases, particularly using SQL. The task was to reflect on my skills and interests to understand how they align with my personal and professional goals. This involved identifying the areas I excel in, what I enjoy doing most, and how these can shape my future career.I looked at my academic projects, such as building applications using Java and Kotlin, and managing data through SQL. I also explored machine learning out of personal interest, taking time to understand how data is used to create intelligent systems. I identified transferable skills like problem-solving, attention to detail, communication, and teamwork, which I’ve developed through both individual and group tasks.
 
This reflection helped me realize that I am most passionate about solving problems using code, understanding how systems work, and working with data. My interest in machine learning and databases continues to grow, and I am now focused on developing those skills further.I feel more confident in the direction I want to take and more intentional about the projects I pursue.

### 🔍 Reflection 
  
As a final-year ICT student planning my next steps, I took part in a **Personality Assessment** module based on the Holland Code (RIASEC) model. I’ve always known I enjoy tech, but this was my first time intentionally connecting my personality to real career options in the field. I wanted to understand not just what I’m good at, but *why certain tasks energize me more than others. The task involved exploring six personality types — Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional — and identifying which ones best describe me. The goal was to reflect on how these traits influence my career preferences, learning style, and how I function in a team or work setting.

I took time to complete the assessment honestly, answering questions about what I enjoy, how I solve problems, and the kinds of work environments I prefer. My results highlighted both **Investigative** and **Conventional** traits.  
To go deeper, I:
- Revisited my academic and personal projects (e.g., building a weather app and writing SQL queries) to see how these traits showed up in practice.  
- Compared personality descriptions with my experiences — realizing that my love for structured data, step-by-step problem-solving, and deep analysis clearly align with these two types.  
- Reflected on how I thrive in organized, logic-driven environments where I can work independently but also support broader team objectives.


The assessment gave me clarity: I’m naturally drawn to roles that require precision, problem-solving, and structure — like data analysis, backend development, or even machine learning engineering.  
It also helped me accept that it’s okay to prefer solo work when I’m focused, and that I bring real value through consistency, analytical thinking, and systems-oriented work. This reflection is now shaping how I tailor my CV, choose electives, and even who I look to for mentorship. It reminded me that success comes not just from skills, but from aligning with your core personality.

### ✨ 🏁 Reflection 
 
As part of my career preparation, I completed a **CV creation module** to learn how to effectively showcase my skills, experience, and qualifications to potential employers. This task involved both theoretical learning (via quizzes) and practical application.

 
The objectives were to Understand the core purpose and structure of a professional CV, learn how to organize sections (e.g., work experience, education, skills) for maximum impact.Identify common mistakes and best practices in CV writing.
  
I approached this task by:
1. **Engaging with the quiz questions** to test my understanding of CV fundamentals (e.g., reverse-chronological order for work experience).
2. **Reviewing my incorrect response** about the primary purpose of a CV (initially selecting "t" instead of the correct answer) to clarify misconceptions.
3. **Drafting a sample CV** based on the guidelines, ensuring:
   - Clear section headers (Skills, Education, Work Experience).
   - Concise bullet points using action verbs (e.g., "Developed," "Managed").
   - Tailored content for my target field (e.g., IT, Design, etc.).

This task helped me:
- **Master CV structure**: I now know how to prioritize information (e.g., placing recent work experience first).
- **Highlight transferable skills**: I can better articulate my strengths (e.g., "Problem-solving" or "Project Management").
- **Avoid pitfalls**: Learned to exclude irrelevant details and keep the CV to 1–2 pages.  
Moving forward, I’ll **update my CV quarterly** and customize it for specific job applications.
